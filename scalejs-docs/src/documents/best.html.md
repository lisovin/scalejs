# Best Practices

<hr>

Scalejs does not strictly force you to follow a particular style or format. However, when we created the framework,
we believed there were certain best practices that could be followed to make writing and maintaing code not only
easier but also enjoyable. Since these are not relevant to the core application pattern, but still recommended
for your satisfaction and sanity, they will be covered in this section.

## Debugging

Scalejs is ideal for debugging as it makes it easy to build and run projects in debug or release modes.
In debug mode, we recommend using a Browser Developer Tool (such as Chrome Devtools) to debug your apps.
Run a web-service with the press of 2 buttons. This is the recomended way to debug web applications.

(More on debugging mobile apps coming soon!)

## jsLint

jsLint can be included in your project and makes it easy to quality check your code!

## Intellisense

Intellisense that just works...most of the time :)

## Linq

Beautiful collection manipulation

## LESS

Less is more - don't let your CSS become an unmanageable mess!
