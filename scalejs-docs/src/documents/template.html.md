# Project Template

<hr>

The first thing you will be exposed to after [creating a project](./project.html) is the file structure of the project.

![Files generated by project template](./project2.png)

In this structure there is a bunch of boilerplate code, but it is actually a runable project. 
Projects can be run by pressing __ctrl + f5__. 

The project template consists of:

* __index.html__, the bootstrapper of the app, and __config.js__ a file which specifies the paths to base libraries and scalejs extensions.
* __app folder__, a collection of modules needed in the app, and __app.js__, the file which registers said modules.
* __main folder__, a collection of files needed in the main module, and __mainModule.js__, a file which defines states and ties together the functional and visual aspects of the module.
* __views folder__, a collection of views needed for the main module, and __main.html__, a file containing a view used by the main module.
* __bindings folder__, a collection of bindings needed for the main module, and __mainBindings.js__, the file which contains bindings used by the main module.
* __viewmodels folder__, a collection of viewmodels needed in the main module, and __mainViewModel.js__, the file which contains a viewmodel used by the main module.
* __styles folder__, a collection of styles needed in the main module, and __main.css__ or __main.less__, the file which contains the styles used by the main module.
* __Scripts folder__, a collection of base libraries and extensions
* __test folder__, a folder containing unit tests for the application

This section will introduce you to the code and purpose of these files. How you can expand to these files to do more complex things will be covered in another section.

### index.html and config.js

index.html is the starting point for your app. 

__index.html__
```xml
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <script src="config.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
        <script src="Scripts/require.js" data-main="app/app" type="text/javascript"></script>
        <title>helloworld application (development version).</title>
    </head>
    <body>
    </body>
</html>
```

Only two scripts are referenced in this file: config.js and require.js. 
The use of [requirejs](http://requirejs.org/) allows us to write code in seperate files,
while also maintaining dependencies and ensuring files get loaded in order.
It also allows us to write code without adding variables to the global namespace,
as it provides function scope.

__require.js__

The most important aspect of this file is that it tells requirejs that our starting point is the [app folder](./template.html#app-folder-and-app-js)
You also will notice we have other index files, e.g. _index.debug.html_, _index.release.html_, and _index.test.html_.
_index.release_ and _index.debug_ serve a similar purpose as _index_ but they load concatenated versions of your
application where as _index.html_ will load files in their respective directories. 
The difference between the two is that _index.release_ will load a minified version of your app. 
These will be used once you [build the application](./build.html). 
_index.test_ is different; it will allow you to run unit tests for your code. 
More information on testing can be found [here](./test.html).

__config.js__

config.js tells requirejs what base libraries and extensions need to be loaded.
It is automatically editted whenever you install, update, or uninstall an extension via NuGet,
so you will not need to edit this file unless you are have an intermidiate understanding
of scalejs and are ready to [build your own extension](./extension.html). 


### app folder and app.js

The app folder contains a single file __app.js__ as well as folders for the modules in your application.

__app.js__
```javascript
/*global require*/
require([
    'scalejs!application/main'
], function (
    application
) {
    'use strict';

    application.run();
});
```

This is the bootstrapper of your app; it loads the modules and runs the application.
Modules can be registered and loaded by appending a comma followed by the module's name to `scalejs!application/main`. 
For example, if you add a new module and name it _new_, your would need to change `scalejs!application/main` to `scalejs!application/main,new`

When adding a new module, you would do so by __right clicking on the app folder__, selecting __Add > New Item__,
and selecting the appropriate template for a Scalejs Module. 
If you are using a project with LESS, select a __Scalejs LESS Module__, and if you are using a project with CSS,
select __Scalejs CSS Module__. 

### main folder and mainModule.js

The main folder contains the files needed for the main module.
Typically, the main module is the shell of your application and will be used to define the layout for your app
by creating regions to contain content from other modules. 
It also can define styles specific to your application.

A folder for a module contains of a file which will be run when the module is loaded. 
In the case of main, this file is called __mainModule.js__.
Similarly, additional modules will follow the naming convention __<moduleName>Module.js__

__mainModule.js__
```javascript
/*global define */
define([
    'sandbox!main',
    'app/main/viewmodels/mainViewModel',
    'views!main',
    'bindings!main',
    'styles!main'
], function (
    sandbox,
    mainViewModel
) {
    'use strict';

    return function main() {
        var // imports
            root = sandbox.mvvm.root,
            template = sandbox.mvvm.template,
            registerStates = sandbox.state.registerStates,
            state = sandbox.state.builder.state,
            onEntry = sandbox.state.builder.onEntry,
            // vars
            viewModel = mainViewModel();

        // Register application state for the module.
        registerStates('root',
            state('app',
                state('main',
                    onEntry(function () {
                        // Render viewModel using 'main_template' template 
                        // (defined in main.html) and show it in the `root` region.
                        root(template('main_template', viewModel));
                    }))));
    };
});
```

This file consists of a [requirejs](http://requirejs.org/) module which is used to load the views, viewmodels,
bindings, and styles for the module. Requirejs modules differ from scalejs modules as a requirejs module
is created using `define` and is used also to define viewmodels and bindings. A scalejs module, on the other hand,
is a combination of html and javscript files needed to implement a specific feature for your app which is independent
of other features of the app. The purpose of the __mainModule.js__ file is to setup the module;
it does not solve functional tasks, its primary job is to tie the other components of the modules together by including them
at the top of define as seen above and define the [statechart](./statechart.html).

_Read more about [Modules](./architecture.html#modules)_

### view folder and main.html

The view folder is a container of [views](./mvvm.thml#views) and includes one view file for the main module:

__main.html__
```xml
<div id="main_template">
    <span class="main text" data-class="main-text"></span> from helloworld.
</div>
```

It consists of a single template, `main_template`. This template text which is bound to a `data-class` named `main-text`.
The purpose of the view is to contain the templates needed for the module. Usually, it is neccesary to bind components
of templates to data which is signified by `data-class`. 
`data-class` connects your view to your bindings, which will be discussed next.

_Read more about [Views](./mvvm.html#views)_

### bindings folder and mainBindings.js

Bindings define the data-classes which are used in the view. Bindings rarely exist on their own;
they are always referenced by a view. Since __main.html__ defines a `data-class` property,
it _must_ be created in the bindings. This data-class is defined in __mainBindings.js__

__mainBindings.js__
```javascript
/*global define */
/*jslint sloppy: true*/
define({
    'main-text': function () {
        return {
            text: this.text
        };
    }
});
```

`data-class` provides similar functionality to what is found in `data-bind` which is provided by [knockoutjs](http://knockoutjs.com/).
More specifically, `data-class` extends the capabilities of knockout by allowing you to define your data-binds in a seperate
file. This avoids ugly inline html for more complex code.

Bindings are what connects your view to your viewmodel. The viewmodel is covered in the next section.

_Read more about [Bindings](./mvvm.html#bindings)_

### viewmodels folder and mainViewModel.js

Viewmodels are what perform the logical and functional tasks of your module.
Viewmodels also define the model for your view; e.g. whatever needs to be in your view
which is data-centric or requires dynamic modification must be defined and exposed by a viewmodel.
The viewmodel used in the main module is __mainViewModel.js__

__mainViewModel.js__
```javascript
/*global define */
define([
    'sandbox!main'
], function (
    sandbox
) {
    'use strict';

    return function () {
        var // imports
            observable = sandbox.mvvm.observable,
            // properties
            text = observable('Hello World');

        return {
            text: text
        };
    };
});
```

In this file, we have exposed the `text` observable which was referenced in the bindings in the previous section.

_Read more about [ViewModels](./mvvm.html#viewmodel)_


### styles folder and main.css or main.less

Styles are what are used modify the visual aspect of your modules.
There is nothing special about the style which is provided by the template.
However, we do recommend giving thought to the order and structure of styles when building a large application.
These recommendations can be found in the styles section.

### Scripts

The Scripts folder contains a combination of core scalejs files, scalejs extensions, and base libraries.
The difference between extensions and base libraries are one of the key advantages of scalejs.

### test

The test folder contains unit tests which are provided by the [jasmine](http://pivotal.github.io/jasmine/)
testing framework. 

__all.tests.js__
```javascript
/*global define,jasmine*/
define([
    'jasmine-html',
    'scalejs!application',
    './mainViewModel.test'
], function () {
    'use strict';

    var jasmineEnv = jasmine.getEnv(),
        htmlReporter = new jasmine.HtmlReporter();

    jasmineEnv.updateInterval = 1000;
    jasmineEnv.addReporter(htmlReporter);

    jasmineEnv.specFilter = function (spec) {
        return htmlReporter.specFilter(spec);
    };

    jasmineEnv.execute();
});
```

This file starts the tests. Add new tests by referencing them in the first argument of `define`
like how `./mainViewModel.test` is defined.

__mainViewModel.test.js__
```javascript
/*global define,describe,expect,it*/
/*jslint sloppy: true*/
/// <reference path="../Scripts/jasmine.js"/>
define([
    'scalejs!core',
    'app/main/viewmodels/mainViewModel',
    'scalejs!application'
], function (core, mainViewModel) {
    describe('`mainViewModel`', function () {
        var vm = mainViewModel(core.buildSandbox('main.test'));

        it('text is set to "Hello World" after initialization.', function () {
            expect(vm).toBeDefined();
            expect(vm.text()).toBe('Hello World');
        });
    });
});
```

This test checks if the mainViewModel was loaded and text observable from the mainViewModel is 'Hello World!'

__In order to run the tests, open the index.test.html page in your browser.__
