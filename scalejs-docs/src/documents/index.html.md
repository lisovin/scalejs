## Extendable
Extensibility is essential for building maintainble and scalable applications. 
The scalejs core is small and is designed to be extended to provide the features your application needs.
They are installed and updated via NuGet which allows you to focus less on maintaining old code, and more on writing new code.

## Build Large Applications
Scalejs is designed for building large and robust applications. 
It allows you to create modular apps which mean organized and loosely-coupled code. 
You also can write and run tests for your app.

<br>

## Visual Studio Integration
You gain full access to the features in Visual Studio througout the development lifecycle. Scalejs comes with Visual Studio templates to get you started with your development. 
You can manage packages with NuGet easily, and also develop your own. 
Building and Running your project is a breeze and does the work of starting up a web server and creating deployable packages for you. 
Intellisense, a much beloved and useful feature, is provided for the entire scalejs API as well as code you write yourself.
Not to mention that if your application relies on a .NET backend, you do not need to maintain seperate development enviroments and your team can code in one place.

<br>

##Mobile
Scalejs is optimized to run anywhere. 
When you build your application, you will wind up with seperate packages for Web, Android, IPad, and Windows 8. 
These will allow your web applications to have a native mobile feel to them; the user won't even know they're actually running an application created by HTML5 and JavaScript.
Code once, deploy anywhere will allow your team to be more productive and efficient.

##Extensive
Scalejs core will allow you to add extensions as needed, and everything you need is already there for you to use.
Most applications will make use of the MVVM pattern, state management, layout, and routing, so we've already created these extensions. 
We also have developed various UI components such as grids, treemaps, and charts.
